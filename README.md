## Purpose

To practice conditional decision-making using the if–else structure in C by checking whether an entered character is a numeric digit.

Use an if condition to check if the character lies between '0' and '9'.

If true → print "Digit".

Else → print "Not digit".

## Example Input/Output
1) Enter a character: 5  
   Digit

2) Enter a character: A  
   Not digit

## Key Concepts Practiced

Use of if–else statement

Character comparison

Understanding of ASCII value range for digits
